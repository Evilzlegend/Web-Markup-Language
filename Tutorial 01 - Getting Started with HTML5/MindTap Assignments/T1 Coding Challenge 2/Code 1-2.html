<h1>Revelation</h1>
<h2>by Robert Frost</h2>

<p>We make ourselves a place apart <br />
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbspBehind light words that tease and flout,<br />
But oh, the agitated heart<br />
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbspTill someone find us really out. <br />
</P>
<p>
'Tis pity if the case require<br />
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(Or so we say) that in the end<br />
We speak the literal to inspire<br />
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe understanding of a friend.<br />
</p>
<p>
But so with all, from babes that play<br />
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt hide-and-seek to God afar,<br />
So all who hide too well away<br />
     &nbsp&nbsp&nbspMust speak and tell us there they are.<br />
</p>
